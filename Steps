1. Containerization: Containerize both the front-end and API by creating Dockerfiles.
2. CI/CD: Write a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment of the containers once your source code is changed.
3. Kubernetes YAML Files: Create deployment and service YAML files for both the Next.js front-end and the FastAPI backend.
4. Kubernetes Setup: Set up a Kubernetes service within your cloud provider (Azure AKS, Amazon EKS, or GCP GKE).
5. Container Deployment: Deploy the front-end, API, and storage containers to the Kubernetes cluster.
6. Interconnectivity: Ensure the containers are interconnected for seamless data flow.
7. CI/CD Implementation: Set up a CI/CD pipeline to deploy the containers and application after the source code changes.
    Use tools like GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps.

8. Monitoring: Set up monitoring for containers to track key metrics and insights.
    Use Azure Monitor for AKS, Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights for EKS, or Grafana for advanced monitoring.
